# Grey Dungeons
## A fantasy text adventure game made in Python

Grey Dungeons is a simple text adventure game where you navigate through a dungeon- which isn't without its surprises!

I agree about that taste, but that's not the point. Grey Dungeons has a lot of hidden things of interest that you probably won't understand, but half the fun is discovering the stuff I've put in there. Have fun!
